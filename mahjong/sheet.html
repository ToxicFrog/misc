<table><tr><th colspan=1>Overview</th></tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">A game of Mahjong is played in multiple <b>rounds</b>, with each round consisting of several <b>hands</b>. The overall goal of the game is to score the most points; the goal of each hand is to form a <b>winning hand</b> of tiles before anyone else does. Most winning hands will consist of four <b>melds</b> (chows, pungs, or kongs) and one matched pair of tiles, but how many points a winning hand is worth depends on what's in it and how it was built.<br><br>    These rules are based on one particular version of Hong Kong Old Style Mahjong, but there are innumerable variants of the game, with different tiles, scoring rules, and even rules of play. Feel free to tweak these rules to make it more fun; just make sure everyone in the group agrees what rules you are playing with before you start!</td>

<table><tr><th colspan=1>Setup</th></tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">(1) Choose a player to be East. Seat players counterclockwise E-S-W-N (reverse compass order). Decide on scoring rules.<br>    (2) Shuffle tiles and build four walls, each one 18 tiles wide and 2 high. Push them together into a square.<br>    (3) East rolls 3d6; count that many seats around the table. That player counts that many tiles from the edge of their wall and breaks the wall there. Players will draw tiles from the right side of the break.<br>    (4) Players draw two tiles at a time, starting with East, until everyone has 12 tiles; then one more tile each to make 13.<br>    (5) The round wind always starts at East, so the East player gets the first turn.</td>
</tr>

<table><tr><th colspan=1>Between Hands</th></tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">If a hand ends in a tie, just reshuffle the tiles, rebuild the walls, and play another hand.<br>    If someone won, but not everyone has been the first player yet this round, the <b>seat winds</b> change; the player after the current East becomes the new East (with the players after them being South, West, and North).<br>    If everyone has already been first player this round, the <b>round wind</b> changes instead, in the same order: East➞South➞West➞North. The player whose seat matches the new round wind goes first.</td>

<td class="text">Players start with 500 <b>points</b>. The overall winner is the one with the most points at the end of the game.<br>      Hands are scored in <b>faan</b>. Before playing, players should agree on a minimum number of faan to declare victory (usually 1-3) and a maximum faan per hand (usually 7 or 10; sometimes 13).<br>      When someone wins a hand, the other players give them points based on the faan-to-points table below. If they won by stealing a tile from someone, the person they stole it from pays double. If they won by drawing a tile, <b>everyone</b> pays double.</td>
