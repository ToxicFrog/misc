## Game Setup
- pick an East player. This is the dealer.
- set the prevailing wind to East.
- turn order CCW from East: E-S-W-N. (This does not match the compass.)
- shuffle tiles; each player then builds a 18-long, 2-high wall face down
- east rolls 3d6, counts that many times CCW around the table (starting with themself),
  then that many tiles CW from that player's right corner, and draws four
- drawing proceeds around the table, 4 at a time, until everyone has 12
- everyone draws 1, then East draws another one and discards one; play begins with South

### Three Player Variant (hong kong old style)

- Remove 2-8 of kanji
- Use HKOS scoring variant 3

## Game Shutdown
- If the game was a draw: restart
- Otherwise: rotate the compass counterclockwise (the South player becomes East and is now the dealer, etc)
- If the compass has gone all the way around, increment the prevailing wind as well

## Patterns

The goal is to attain "mahjong" by having four of these patterns and a pair in your hand. They can be "concealed" (in your hand, or in some cases played face down) or "exposed/melded" (played face up after taking another player's discard).

### Chow (three in a row)

Run of three consecutive numbers. Form concealed or by taking the discard from the player to your left.

### Pung (three of a kind)

Three of a kind. Form concealed or by taking the discard from **any** player: call "pung" and grab the discard as soon as they finish their turn. In the latter case play resumes CCW from you.

### Kong (four of a kind)

Cannot be formed in hand as it leaves you unable to call mahjong. Three variants, depending on how you form it. After forming a kong, **you must draw a "replacement tile" from the back of the wall before discarding**. If drawing a replacement tile makes it possible for you declare another kong, you are allowed to do so (and draw another replacement, etc).
- **concealed kong** is made by adding a tile to a concealed pung; you play the kong face down. You don't have to declare it as soon as you get it; you can save it for a later turn (or decide you don't want it and break it apart).
- **exposed big kong** is made by stealing a discard (from any player) to add to a concealed pung; the kong is played half face down, half face up.
- **exposed small kong** is made by adding a tile from your hand to an exposed pung.

### Bonus Tiles

If you draw a flower or season tile, immediately set it aside and draw a replacement; they are used for scoring.

### Limit Hands

Special patterns that end the game with a large score bonus for you. Too many to detail here.

## Game Flow

- Normal Turn
  - Draw a tile from the wall
  - [Optional] declare concealed or small kong (not necessarily using that tile)
    - Draw replacement and optionally recurse
  - Discard
- Exposure Turn
  - Draw preceding player's discard
  - Declare exposed chow, pung, big kong, or mahjong
    - If big kong, draw replacement and optionally recurse
  - Discard
- Interrupt
  - Declare **after any other player discards**
  - Take the discard and proceed as "Exposure Turn" except that you cannot chow
  - Discard; play continues to your right even if this means skipping someone's turn
  - If multiple players interrupt, pung and big kong take priority over chow, and mahjong over everything
  - In case of priority tie, soonest player in turn order wins
- Interrupt (Robbing the Kong)
  - Declare after any other player upgrades an exposed pung to an exposed small kong
  - Take the tile they used for that and go mahjong

## Scoring (Hong Kong Old Style variant 3)

Scoring is in *fan*, where more fan == more points, but nonlinearly (roughly 2^(fan/2) but it's more complicated than that). Most games require a minimum number of fan before you can call mahjong, typically 3.

- Fan for Winning
  - 0: win by discard
    - 2 if it's the last discard of the game
  - 1 win by drawing from the wall
    - 2 if it's the last tile
    - +3 if it's the last wall tile and it's 1 Orb [Moon from the Sea]
  - 1 win by interrupting someone else's small kong
  - 2 win from the replacement tile you draw after kong
    - +3 if from the replacement you draw after 2 kongs in one turn
    - +3 if it's 5 Orb and you use it in a 4-5-6 chow [Plum Blossoms on the Roof]
- Alternate Win
  - 6 All Flowers and Seasons (if you have 7 you can rob the 8th)
  - 8 The Thirteen Orphans (one of each honour, one each of 1 and 9 of each suit, anything for the 13th)
  - 8 The Blessing of Heaven (East wins with initial hand)
  - 8 The Blessing of Earth (anyone else wins with initial hand)
- Whole-hand Bonuses
  - +1 whole hand is concealed
  - +1 all chows + pair of suit cards
  - +3 for all pungs
  - +3 exactly one suit present (honours allowed) [Half Flush]
  - +6 exactly one suit present, no honours [Full Flush]
  - +8 only honour tiles present
  - +8 four concealed pungs or kongs
- Winds
  - +1 pung of round wind
  - +1 pung of seat wind
  - +6 three pungs + 1 pair winds [Small Winds]
  - +8 four pungs winds [Great Winds]
- Dragons
  - +1 at least one pung of dragons
  - +3 two pung + 1 pair dragons [Small Dragons]
  - +6 three pung dragons [Great Dragons]
- Nature Bonuses
  - +1 per flower or season tile
  - +1 no flower tiles
  - +1 flower or season of the round
  - +1 flower or season of your seat

### Fan to Points

First, the table is used to convert fan into points:

```
   Fan  0  1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8    9    10   11   12   13   14   15   16
Points  2  4  8  16  32  48  64  96  128  192  256  384  512  768  1024 1536 2048
```
N.b. usually 13 is the maximum.


Then, if the win was from the wall, everyone gives the winner that many points; if the win was from discard, the discarder gives the winner that many and everyone else gives them half.

Everyone starts with some arbitrary number of points if playing casually, maybe 512 or 1024.

### Simplified scoring for Alex

- 1 points per chow
- 2 points per pung
- 3 points per kong
- +1 if you have dragons
- +1 if you have winds
- +1 if entire hand matches: all chow, all pung, all kong, all dragons, all winds, or all the same suit
- +1 per nature tile
