## misc

Miscellaneous small tools not worth their own repository.

`master` contains single-file tools, currently:

* booklog, a simple tool for managing a list of books read
* mp3tree, a shell script for taking a tree of music files in various formats and emitting a tree of MP3s
* uhs.lua, a script for decoding substitution ciphers (so named because my first use of it was on Universal Hint System files)

`ksp` contains a defunct mod manager for Kerbal Space Program. It's kept around as a historical curiousity, but these days you should be using CKAN.

If you're looking for the Music Organizer, `mo`, that now lives in [its own repo](https://github.com/toxicfrog/mo).
