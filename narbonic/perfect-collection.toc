# This is Hardâ„¢.
# Unlike volume 1, which adopts a simple 1 page == 1 jpeg image approach and
# just uses the PDF format as a container, volume 2 uses actual PDF structure
# and places high-res PNG images on the page.
# We solve this by using the same approach as volume 1 for assembling the final
# document (images+text -> html -> pdf), but rather than using pdfimages to
# extract entire pages and then slicing them up with imagemagick, we use it to
# extract individual strips and then weave them back together.
# This results in more deviation from the original PDF (e.g the page footer
# looks different) but smaller file sizes and higher quality.
