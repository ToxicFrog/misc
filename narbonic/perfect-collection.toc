# Index page for adding commentary to Narbonic: The Perfect Collection
# This is not compatible with build-narbonic, since the way pages are referenced
# is very different.

# Format is volume to declare a volume, then:
# fetch <list of website page names> to fetch those pages and add their commentary
# to the queue
# copy START-END to copy these pages as is from the PDF
# annotate START-END to copy these pages and pull commentary from the queue for them
# split-annotate START-END to split these pages into strips and pull commentary from the queue
# drop N to drop the next N commentary blocks

# Settings.

# This is Hardâ„¢.
# Unlike volume 1, which adopts a simple 1 page == 1 jpeg image approach and
# just uses the PDF format as a container, volume 2 uses actual PDF structure
# and places high-res PNG images on the page.
# I have a few options here.
# I can pre-render the pages to JPEG and then use the same pipeline as for the
# first book. This is easiest.
# A better approach is to use pdfseparate to split off just the pages I want to
# edit, then pdfunite to combine the edited versions back together with the
# originals. This preserves non-edited pages at full quality and keeps them
# relatively small.
# I can raster out the pages as PNG, and splice them back together as PNG. That
# might actually be smaller, and there will definitely be less quality loss.
# E: it's definitely like 10x smaller, I should do this if anything.
# I can decompile the PDF to PS, and edit the PS to enlarge pages, move images
# and footers around, and insert commentary, then compile it back to PDF. This
# would probably give the best results, but is also probably the most difficult.
# I could edit the PDF structure directly. Ok, I think *this* is the best results/
# highest difficulty option.
# I could extract the images and use LaTeX to generate the commentary ex nihilo.
# This would give excellent-quality results but be a lot of work to set up and
# add a bunch more dependencies, plus I'd need to spend a lot of time tweaking
# the LaTeX to get things to come out approximately the same as the original, and
# it would probably never exactly match.
